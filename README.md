THrough this project my group members and I simulated the 2021 Canadian Election through various ranked voting methods. We used data from each electoral district to simulate elections using Borda Count, Instant Run-Off and Defeat-Dropping Condorcet implementations of ranked voting. We used the simulations to compare how different voting techniques influence the results of the election. In addition, comparison of simulations with and without stratification were also done to assess how the variance of simulations differ.
