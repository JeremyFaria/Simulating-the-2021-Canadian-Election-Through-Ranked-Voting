First-past-the-post voting is currently used for Canadian federal elections and is criticized
for not being representative of actual voting preferences. This study simulates alternative
outcomes of different ranked choice voting (RCV) systems, including Instant Runoff
Voting (IVR), Borda Count, and Defeat-Dropping Condorcet (DDC) and how confident we
are in our predictions through variance among simulations. In addition, the effect on
variance when simulating using stratification will be observed as well. Voting preference
rankings were simulated using a Dirichlet distribution based on voting data of the 2021
federal election and Ipsos polling data on second choice preferences. Our results of our
simulations suggest that IVR, Borda Count, and DDC favour the Liberal party. In addition,
using an F-test it was found that simulations using stratification had the variance decrease
when compared to not using stratification. These findings highlight how the choice of an
RCV method influences the federal election results and strategic considerations for parties
in advocating an electoral reform
